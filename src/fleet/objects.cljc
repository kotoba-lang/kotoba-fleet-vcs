  "⑰ kotoba-git object-plane block transfer for P3b (ADR-2607160005).

  P3b gossip replicates the fleet HEAD (a single record). This module adds
  the actual OBJECT-GRAPH transfer: once a machine learns a peer's head-cid,
  it computes what git objects it is missing (kotoba-git.log/missing-since —
  the pull-negotiation primitive) and pulls exactly those blocks, verifying
  it can reconstruct the head afterward. No silent full-repo copy; only the
  delta the receiver lacks moves.

  Pure cljc over a kotoba-git arrangement db (objects are datoms keyed by
  content hash). Needs the kotoba-git classpath (arrangement/prolly-tree/
  io-ipld/io-multiformats/org-ietf-cbor + @noble/hashes on npm)."
