(ns fleet.governor-bridge
  "Governor integration (ADR-2607160005 / ADR-2607141700): map a fleet quorum
  land-back outcome (propose -> govern -> canonical advance) to the shape the
  cloud-itonami ops-runner audit ledger uses, so a fleet governance decision
  is verifiable by the EXISTING governor (ops-runner) and appended to its
  signed audit trail (refs/itonami/audit/main) in a format it already
  understands.

  The two governance loops converge here: fleet's `govern` (quorum signatures
  over a canonical pin advance) produces the same kind of terminal, signed,
  outcome-carrying receipt the ops-runner produces (verify -> handler ->
  signed receipt). This module is the pure mapping; signing/verification uses
  the real cloud-itonami.ops-runner/sign-receipt + verify-receipt (proven
  interoperable under nbb: a fleet-shaped receipt signs and verifies TRUE with
  the actual ops-runner, tamper rejected).

  Pure cljc — no ops-runner require here (the ops-runner is on a heavier
  classpath); a bin entrypoint composes this mapping with the real
  sign/verify. This mirrors the ops-runner-vs-VCS-stack decoupling: compose by
  the plain-map receipt shape, not by a hard dependency."
