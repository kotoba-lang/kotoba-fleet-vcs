(ns fleet.grant
  "Delegation-chain grants + Governor quorum policy (Phase 2, ADR-2607160005).

  Chains carry authority from an owner root did:key to agent did:keys with
  attenuation — same semantics as cacao-clj's verify-chain (root-first /
  leaf-last, child.resources ⊆ parent, child.iss == parent.aud, expiry),
  in a fleet-native canonical encoding that runs on nbb. Aligning the wire
  format with real CAIP-122 CACAO (cacao-clj) is a tracked follow-up; the
  *rules* are identical so the swap is an encoding change, not a semantics
  change.

  Quorum policy (Radicle crefs transplanted as data):
    {:canonical {:allow #{did ...} :threshold 2}}
  Canonical advances need >= threshold distinct valid signatures from the
  allow set — defense-in-depth against single-key compromise, not
  distributed decision-making."
