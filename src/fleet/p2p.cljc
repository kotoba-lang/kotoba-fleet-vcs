  "Phase 3b: gossip replication of the signed fleet head between fleet
  machines (ADR-2607160005). Wire-compatible with kotoba-lang/p2p's
  head-announce: a message is
    {:type :head-announce :graph :head-cid :seq :origin :from :fleet-head}
  where :fleet-head is the P3a signed head record (fleet.pin shape). Per
  kotoba-rad.announce's insight, a signed announce IS a sigref — no new
  signing primitive, we carry and verify the existing fleet head.

  This is the announce/verify/adopt subset (what a single-record head needs),
  not block-chasing (want-since/bitswap) — the fleet head is one record, not
  a chain of blocks to fetch. Full object-plane transfer (kotoba-git graphs)
  is a later slice. GitHub is thereby demoted to a mirror: machines learn
  each other's fleet head over this gossip, not by polling GitHub.

  Pure cljc; verify-fn injected. Trust set = the fleet keyring's roots +
  canonical allow (the dids permitted to announce a canonical fleet head)."
