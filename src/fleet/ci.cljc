  "Native CI for fleet-vcs (ADR-2607160005): content-addressed, signed
  verification receipts, modelled on kotobase code_graph's execution-receipt
  (put-execution-receipt!) — provenance whose CID authenticates the record
  and whose verdict is `required ⊆ passed` (the same shape as that layer's
  `required-effects ⊆ granted-effects`). This replaces the ephemeral GitHub
  Actions log with a durable, queryable attestation on the same kotobase
  IStore stream substrate the delta op-log uses.

  A receipt records: which checks ran over a subject (a repo pin, or the
  fleet-db head), which are REQUIRED, which PASSED, the overall outcome, and
  who signed it. Content-addressed (sha256 of the canonical payload) + signed
  (fleet ed25519). Pure cljc; crypto/hash injected."
