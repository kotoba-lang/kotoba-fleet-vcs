  "fleet-db — the Phase 0 read model (ADR-2607160005).

  The db value is the map produced by fleet.west/parse:
    {:fleet/header .. :fleet/footer .. :fleet/remotes [..] :fleet/repos [entity ..]}
  persisted as one EDN file. west.yml is the *projection* of this value
  (fleet.west/emit); in Phase 0 the direction of truth is still west.yml ->
  fleet-db (import), and flips in Phase 1.

  Alongside the db file sits an append-only ledger (one EDN map per line,
  monotonic :event/seq — same shape as canvas-ledger.edn). Phase 0 only
  records events; admission-gate enforcement is Phase 1."
