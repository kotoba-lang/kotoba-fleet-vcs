  "Phase 1 (ADR-2607160005): signed pin head records + the admission gate.

  A pin advance is no longer a generated line in a YAML file — it is a signed,
  parent-covering head record admitted (or rejected) by a pure decision
  function. The three admission invariants that verify-west-pins.cljs + CI +
  convention emulate today become preconditions of the transaction itself:

    1. authority     — the signer holds a pin-advance grant covering the repo
    2. monotonicity  — :pin/sequence strictly increases; rollback is rejected
                       in the same layer as signature verification
    3. reachability  — :pin/value is reachable from the upstream default
                       branch (checked server-side; injected here)

  Parent-covering (the Radicle 1.7.0 sigrefs-replay CVE lesson, day 1):
  the signed payload includes the hash of the *previous accepted record*,
  so an old valid record cannot be replayed as a new head.

  Pure cljc: crypto is injected as fns — {:verify-fn (fn [pubkey bytes sig])
  :hash-fn (fn [s] hex)} — nbb wires node:crypto, JVM wires ed25519-clj.
  Signer ids are \"ed25519:<pubkey-hex>\" in Phase 1; migrating ids to
  did:key via kotoba-lang ed25519/did libs is Phase 2 (identity plane)."
