;; fleet kdb — live backend flip (ADR-2607160005): persist fleet-db through
;; the real kotobase-peer commit chain (content-addressed, verifiable), with
;; a durable file-backed block store, instead of a re-imported EDN blob. The
;; chain head CID is the fleet-db's durable identity; hydrate reconstructs it.
;; Run with the kotobase classpath (see kdb-run below).
;;   persist --db fleet-db.edn --blocks <dir> --head <head-ptr.edn>
;;   hydrate --blocks <dir> --head <head-ptr.edn> [--out fleet-db-hydrated.edn]
;;   verify  --db fleet-db.edn --blocks <dir> --head <head-ptr.edn>
